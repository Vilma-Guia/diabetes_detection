# Patient Diabetes Detection | Ensemble Learning
- Developed a diagnostic model using ensemble methods (Boosting, Stacking, and Cascading) to predict diabetes onset with high precision.
- Benchmarked Decision Trees, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and SVM against a baseline to optimize predictive accuracy.
- Optimized model performance via PCA-driven dimensionality reduction and automated hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
- Evaluated model robustness by comparing performance on original versus reduced feature sets.
